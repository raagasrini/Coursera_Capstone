Hence, the rspective data was accessed from the Toronto Open Data Catalogue, and subsequently cleaned\n- As a Hindu, I had to find out how many temples existed in Toronto, hence I created a bar chart (descriptive staistics) to show the various faiths and the number of places of worship they had in Toronto. \n- I then used folium libary to plot both the Temples and Retirement home data on the same map to observe which retirement homes might best be suited to cater to my intersets\n- On observation, I found 4 different Retirement homes that suited my interests, on oberving the bed capacity, this was further narrowed down to 2.\n- I then used Foursquare API to assess the venues near both the Retirement Homes to make the final call.\n\nThrough my exploratory analysis, I was able to answer the following questions:\n1. What sort of data would I require to find the optimal Retirement Home?\n2. What are the various religious beliefs of people in Toronto?\n3. What are the various activities I can take up near my retirement home?\n4. Are there enough restaurants and public spaces that allow me to enjoy my time?\n5. What is the size of the community within the Retirement Home?"

Furthermore, it had access to a park, several reaturants of various cuisines, museums and even a castle! It had a bed capacity of 22, which is perfect for me as i enjoy company but enjoy getting to know a few people very well than many people just on the surface. I loved exploring the venues through the screen, i can only imagine exploring them in person!"
